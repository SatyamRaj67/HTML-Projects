          <p>
            Employment is having a paid job. It provides income, purpose, and
            skill development. Types include full-time, part-time, temporary,
            and self-employment. The labor market, influenced by economic
            conditions and policies, determines job availability. High
            employment boosts economic growth, while high unemployment signals
            economic issues.

              <br />
              <p>
                Unemployment in India is a significant issue that affects
                millions of people across the country. It is characterized by
                the lack of job opportunities for individuals who are willing
                and able to work. The causes of unemployment in India are
                multifaceted, including factors such as population growth,
                economic fluctuations, and technological advancements that
                reduce the need for manual labor.

            The Indian government has implemented various schemes and programs
            to address unemployment, such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
            Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), which aims to provide at least
            100 days of wage employment to rural households. Additionally,
            initiatives like Skill India and Make in India are focused on
            enhancing the skill set of the workforce and promoting domestic
            manufacturing to create more job opportunities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Despite these efforts, unemployment remains a persistent challenge,
            particularly among the youth and in rural areas. Addressing this
            issue requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving
            education and vocational training, fostering entrepreneurship, and
            creating a conducive environment for businesses to thrive.
